I often find it's common to merge the role of "tech lead" and "technical project manager". Sure, there are many similarities between the roles. In fact, the leadership attributes David Byttow outlines in his <a href="https://medium.com/@davidbyttow/effective-technical-leadership-b193a544e771">"Effective Technical Leadership" article</a> are relevant for both:
<ul>
	<li>bring the technical knowledge and understanding to the table -- know how things generally work and what you're talking about</li>
	<li>be quick to respond and confident in making fast (but solid) decisions</li>
	<li>know the status of all the moving parts at all times and be aware of surrounding factors</li>
</ul>
Thank you <a href="http://devin.reams.me/">Devin</a> for sharing this with me.

Where the two roles significantly diverge is in the overall objective. The technical lead is primarily focused on supporting the engineering team. The project manager is primarily focused on delivering a successful project -- the project champion, if you will.

The activities of a tech lead and a tech PM are similar and largely spent in the five core activities Byttow outlines: blocking, unblocking, redirecting, deciding, and showing.

But the different motivations manifest in different applications of the activities. For a technical PM this can mean:
<ol>
	<li>Block - preventing things like project gold plating and other negative impacts to the project</li>
	<li>Unblock - getting the team what they need to continue making progress while keeping the client looped in and contributing along the way</li>
	<li>Redirect - tapping into a wealth of expertise across the team while also empowering others to take ownership of the work and contribute back to other team members</li>
	<li>Decide - evaluating options, risk, and correlation with overarching project objectives, to make swift decisions</li>
	<li>Show - demonstrating knowledge and value to both the team and the client to effectively be the trusted point person; the instrumental cog between all the stakeholders</li>
</ol>
In my experience, both roles are important and necessary to consistently deliver up to par. When both roles are treated as one and the same something gets lost. The team loses their technical resource, or the project loses its champion, or the objective shifts constantly between the two.

There are amazing engineers who, as tech leads, help drive project success by coaching their team members and ensuring the strength of development. But the project manager is <em>responsible</em> for that success. To make that happen, I find it requires the technical PM have similar attributes as such a tech lead, doing similar activities, and performing similar actions. With these two roles distinctly defined and backed on a project, then that project is set up to meet and exceed expectations, client and business alike.

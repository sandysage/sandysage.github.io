I love Julia Roberts. I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in this adoration of Julia Roberts with a nickname like "America's Sweetheart." I think her appeal to so many is the approachable, even vulnerable, quality she brings to every character she plays. It makes you feel like you know this person, you grew up with her...and you're willing to forgive her for just about anything.
<h2>Humble + Real = Approachable</h2>
This Julia Roberts' characteristic is something I strive to bring to my role as a project manager - approachable, human, real. I find, if there is a rapport (dare I even say camaraderie?) between the PM, the client, and the team, the project has a significantly better chance of being considered successful by all involved. To get to that point, we - the team, me, the client - have to connect and be in it together. To foster that connection I use urban slang, I crack jokes, I laugh, and I admit mistakes.

I think it's this humble, approachable characteristic that enables me to build partnerships with both the client and the team. And I rely on that partnership because I know there will be times when I need either or both to stretch a little to help me out. And vice versa.

Again, we're all in this together. And isn't it easier to admit something isn't going well, or you have concerns about something, to someone you feel is on your side? Isn't it easier to have negotiations with someone you want to be successful? Don't you want to empower and uplift your comrade, your peer?

I got this kernel of genius from my days with Sandler Sales training, and the "I'm not ok, you're ok" tactic. In principle in looks like this:
<blockquote>If you sense trouble communicating with your prospect, causing him or her to be not-OK, say something like, “I feel from your reaction that I’m not doing a very good job explaining this,” you are taking the not-OK role, “I’m sure I’ve gone through the material much too quickly, and you’ve been very polite about listening.” The prospect is moving toward OK. “Would it be all right if I back-tracked and explained in a little more detail?” - <a href="http://www.dlb.sandler.com/pressitems/show/8608/1316">Sandler Sales</a></blockquote>
Which for me means to mitigate someone's frustration with feeling 'not-OK' by taking a supportive position and owning the 'not-OKness.' It takes humility on my part to make sure a client or a team member feels assured.
<h2>Balance</h2>
This is an incredibly difficult balancing act. On one hand, I am Sandy, your pal, someone you want in the trenches with you when things get rough. On the other, I am the project manager whose confidence is paramount to instilling confidence in both the team and the client. So where do I draw the line?

Well I'm still figuring this out. Recently I found a good example of what <em>not</em> to do. I asked a client, in not so many words, to define what a successful project looks like. Let's be clear, I know what a successful project looks like. But now I've just given the client doubt. Doh!

Of course the intention here was to invite the client in, engage, and provide me with visibility into what a successful project looks like <em>to them</em>. But really what I did was gave the client doubt and cause for concern.

My lesson learned: demonstrate humility, not vulnerability or self-doubt.
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>Build the relationship with the client as their approachable PM, but leave no skepticism of my ability to deliver.</li>
	<li>Connect with my team as their congenial PM, but let it be known that I can get them what they need when they need it.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
And so continues my education in the art of humble confidence.
<h2>Recap</h2>
Despite all the most amazing project management best practices and steller processes, projects can get messy, people can make mistakes, things happen. If the project manager is likable and gracious it can smooth the path to success. Likewise, if the project manager steers the project with confidence, they can drive positive progress. The art comes in knowing how and when to display these two qualities.

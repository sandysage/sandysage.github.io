I mentioned last week there are a few different conflict resolution tactics project managers employ. These are tools that every PM needs to know how to use and leverage. Because, let's face it, we project managers are defacto project therapists. We have to move projects forward with skill and finesse, mitigating conflicts and removing blockers.

So what are these tactics?
<h3>Problem Solving</h3>
While no one approach is better than any other, this method of solving the problem so that everyone wins is my personal go-to. This is the method when everyone can collaborate and come up with a solution(s) that addresses everyone's concerns. It's all about open and direct communication and can be used when:
<ul>
	<li>There is an opportunity for a satisfactory scenario for everyone</li>
	<li>There is a priority to decrease cost</li>
	<li>There is a common power base / everyone is on the same level</li>
	<li>There is time to get creative (schedule is not critical)</li>
</ul>
I had a request to evaluate a provided design for overall usability and provide recommendation. Because we had slated time for this effort, we were able to align the design assessment findings with functional changes that would consolidate a various number of outputs into a handful of features. It's a win-win. It's a better user experience. It's easier to build and maintain. It's overall much more intuitive for both users and administrators.
<h3>Compromise</h3>
My rule of thumb is to compromise when there is little room to do otherwise. Essentially everyone gives something up in order to come to a decision and move forward. Meh.
<ul>
	<li>There is an issue that is deadlocked and there is no clear chance to come to a win-win solution</li>
	<li>There isn't sufficient time to look for alternatives</li>
	<li>Nothing will be achieved if a compromise isn't reached</li>
	<li>The relationship among the involved parties is priority</li>
</ul>
In a recent project I myself agreeing to continue to engage in discovery efforts well into the implementation phase, at no additional cost to the client, to further flesh out additional requirements. In the end, this was time well spent as it allowed us to trim unnecessary development time around the feature when we did finally resolve on an agreeable change order. This effort allowed us all to move the project forward, but both parties lost in the gain. The development team and I lost traction with implementation, while the client had to accommodate the schedule impacts along with the additional budget requirement.
<h3>Smoothing</h3>
There are times when it behooves a team to accommodate a request, sacrificing their own goals / objectives to satisfy another parties concerns. The smoothing approach works when you need to emphasize areas of agreement and downplay the areas of disagreement, for instance when:
<ul>
	<li>You want to make a deposit in the bank of goodwill (create an obligation for a trade-off at a later time)</li>
	<li>The succession is low risk with limited liability</li>
	<li>You will lose anyway</li>
	<li>Time is critical</li>
</ul>
For example, there is a request to make a few style tweaks like changing a line from red to blue. It takes a couple of hours to accommodate these changes with minimal to no impacts to the project timeline, budget, or other core functional design. I call this a gimme or a no-brainer, because I like cliches.
<h3>Forcing</h3>
Forcing is the approach where one party dominates the decision with their agenda. Forcing occurs when one party goes all out to win at the expense of the needs / concerns of other teams. As the intensity of a conflict or the project itself increases, the tendency for a forced method is most likely to occur. Forcing can be useful but has to be used with caution. A few times it makes sense to force the situation would be when:
<ul>
	<li>There is a "make or break" scenario</li>
	<li>Important factors are at stake and the issue is high risk</li>
	<li>Relationship between parties is not important (low value)</li>
	<li>A quick decision is a must</li>
</ul>
The only times I've relied on forcing conflict resolution has been in dire situations. Dire as in the project is about to end, badly, and someone has to stand firm. I can think of one scenario where there were continual egregious requests beyond the scope of work, and refusal to adjust expectations and / or allow for other concessions with scope, budget, and timeline. I accommodated what I reasonably could, but ultimately had to stand fast with references to the SOW and written requirements. Ouch! But unfortunately, when there is no other recourse, and the relationship is already beyond repair, forcing is the only way forward.
<h3>Withdrawal</h3>
Sometimes situations are so intense that the only clear option is to take a step back, and postpone an issue for later or even withdraw from it completely. This is a temporary solution to be used only when:
<ul>
	<li>You can not win, and really no one can</li>
	<li>You are ill prepared to address the matter</li>
	<li>There are more critical matters at hand</li>
	<li>The problem might go away with time</li>
	<li>There can be a win down the line by delaying</li>
</ul>
I once had a request that would require a fundamental architectural shift in how data was stored and presented. Let's say it would require a non-trivial effort at an inopportune time. I pushed and plied for the business reasons, I could not uncover the pain points driving this request. Furthermore this request was from a non-key stakeholder who had no interaction with the site we were constructing. After indulging the conversation just enough to realize that this request was mostly a distraction, I was able to withdraw from it; let things simmer a bit, and see if the requirement resurfaced. It never did. In fact, that person was removed from the project for contributing in other ways to the expansion of the project in non-valuable ways.
<h3>In short...</h3>
Every PM knows the tools available to resolve conflicts, that’s the science. The art is to know what tactic to use and when.

Conflict is my ally. No, I'm not looking to pick a fight. And in fact, I hate a difficult conversation as much as anyone. But without conflict, there is too much left unsaid. This can be as much true in personal relationships as it is in project management.

This is why Project Managers have to be comfortable with conflict, and familiar with resolution tactics.

According to PMBOK (Project Management Book of Knowledge 5th edition, Chapter 9.4), PMs can use any of these conflict resolution techniques:
<ul>
	<li>Problem Solving: Going for a scenario where everyone wins (win-win)</li>
	<li>Compromise: Making concessions. No one gets everything. (lose-lose)</li>
	<li>Forcing: Pushing one way over all others (win-lose)</li>
	<li>Withdrawal: Delaying the decision (neutral-neutral)</li>
	<li>Smoothing: Placating and focusing on the positive with no real confrontation (lose-win)</li>
</ul>
Each approach has it's merits and uses (that's another post). But what won't lead to success is ignoring the conflict. Ignoring the conflict is different than withdrawal or smoothing methods. This is plain, outright pretending a problem doesn't exist.

I was someone, long ago, who could never refuse a request. I was a people pleaser. On one project, there was disagreement around what the scope should include. Instead of addressing the conflict, I hoped it would go away (ostrich management). Ultimately this allowed for significant scope change to be included with no additional concessions for cost and time. This particular project required outside vendor support. With no approval for additional budget, there was no money to pay for the added work. Also, I found there was no real good way to fit in two additional weeks of work into the remaining four weeks of development. As you can imagine, the project went sideways in a bad way. The client relationship tanked. Trust with the vendor was severed. The project team was strained. And day-to-day interactions with all involved parties was stressful, at best. The project was ultimately canceled. <strong>Ignoring the conflict was a very costly failure.</strong>

Ok, so accepting the scope creep was bad. But the real failure was my conflict handling and management. Or rather my lack of it.

Fast forward years later, and I found myself in a similar situation. This time I was prepared (ie I learned from my past mistake(s)), and employed a few tools to address and resolve this conflict:
<ol>
	<li>Immediately identify the conflict, assess the risks, and raise it to everyone's attention (this is most important)</li>
	<li>Ask questions
<ul>
	<li>What is the business case for this change?</li>
	<li>How does this inclusion fit with the rest of the project?</li>
	<li>Is this change a value add or a nice to have?</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Provide options
<ul>
	<li>Do nothing?</li>
	<li>Swap out one chunk of effort for another?</li>
	<li>Revisit this new thing in a phase 2 or retainer effort (post-launch for a new agreement)?</li>
	<li>Adjust the budget and timeline to accommodate the new scope?</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Refer back to the planning documents and requirements to articulate the risks of the change</li>
	<li>Make a decision</li>
	<li>Stick to the decision</li>
</ol>
In this instance, we were able to come to a win-win agreement to include the new work, with minor revisions to the requirements that shaved a significant amount of custom development required. Not all situations afford such a nice resolution, and I'll get into that in my next post. For now, I leave with...
<ul>
	<li>Project conflict is inevitable.</li>
	<li>Conflict presents potential impacts to the quality, scope, budget, and schedule (key performance indicators) risk project success.</li>
	<li>Therefore it's better to be proactive about the conflict, get it out in the open, and get ahead of the potentially damaging issues early.</li>
</ul>
